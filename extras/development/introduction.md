Welcome to the development documentation section! In this section, you will find information on how to develop and install the GEO Knowledge Hub and resources for ongoing maintenance and improvement.

To help you get started, we've included installation guides that walk you through setting up the GEO Knowledge Hub from scratch. These guides cover everything from selecting the right software to configuring your system for optimal development experience.

In addition to installation guides, we provide **R**equest **F**or **C**omments (RFC) documents outlining best practices and standards for our development process.

We've also included onboarding documents that provide a comprehensive GEO Knowledge Hub technology overview to support developers in their work further. These documents cover data management, metadata standards, and user experience design, helping you build a technically sound and user-friendly feature.
