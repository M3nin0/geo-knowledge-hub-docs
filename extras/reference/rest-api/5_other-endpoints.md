As mentioned in previous pages of this documentation, GEO Knowledge Hub is created based on InvenioRDM. So, APIs defined in InvenioRDM are available in the GEO Knowledge Hub â€” for example, API for managing communities, groups, members, and more.

In this documentation of the GEO Knowledge Hub, our focus is to keep documented all the customizations we made in the InvenioRDM. Therefore, if you need or want to explore all available APIs, please refer to the [InvenioRDM documentation](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/rest_api_index/).
