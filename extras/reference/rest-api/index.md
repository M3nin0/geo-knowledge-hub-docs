Welcome to the documentation section for the REST API of the GEO Knowledge Hub, built using [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/). In this section, we will explore the different endpoints and functionality our REST API provides. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide to help you understand how to programmatically interact with our digital library.

We are proud to inform you that GEO Knowledge Hub is a digital library developed based on [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/). We have imported many of the features from InvenioRDM and kept the same behaviors to provide a seamless experience. However, we have also created specific behaviors for functionalities related to managing Knowledge Packages and Knowledge Resources that need to be documented.

We want to acknowledge the InvenioRDM community for creating complete documentation that explains all the necessary elements to use the InvenioRDM. However, the GEO Knowledge Hub has specific modifications. As our goal is to keep our changes in the InvenioRDM documented, we have imported some pages from the InvenioRDM documentation and extended them to explain to our community how the GEO Knowledge Hub can be used.

By doing this, we avoid importing all the fantastic documentation created by the InvenioRDM community. So, if you don't find what you want in this documentation, please check the [InvenioRDM Rest API documentation](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/rest_api_index/).

We thank the InvenioRDM team and community for developing this essential and powerful tool.
