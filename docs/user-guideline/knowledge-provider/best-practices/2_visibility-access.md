**Visibility** is another factor and plays a key role. Sharing your publications, whether it is journal paper or conference proceedings, increases its visibility and impact. And it helps users to understand the scientific basis of your approach.

Equally important is **ensuring effortless access** to the full range of your products. Users should be able to access your application and its features without any barriers or complications. For instance, if it's a web platform you may provide a URL address or if it is a tool that runs locally on a computer provide a download file. Therefore, prioritize accessibility for users.
