:::info

To create a [Knowledge Package](../../../concepts/sharing-units/knowledge-packages.md), your `GEO Knowledge Hub user` must have the [Knowledge Provider](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider) [role](../../../concepts/user-roles.md). If you do not have this permission, [create an account](../../knowledge-user/creating-account/creating-account.md) and [request the required role](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider) for the `GEO Knowledge Hub team`.

:::

Sharing Earth Observation Applications in the `GEO Knowledge Hub` is done through [Knowledge Package](../../../concepts/sharing-units/knowledge-packages.md) creation. This section presents how [Knowledge Providers](../../../concepts/user-roles.md#knowledge-provider) can use the features of the digital library to create these packages.

### Getting ready

The most important work, once as *Knowledge Provider* you decided to share your application in the `GEO Knowledge Hub` is to organize and document your application with the relative resources.

**A checklist of actions is suggested**:

1. Organize the material you want to share;

2. Describe all the materials you have in a document (e.g., `Title`, `Authors`, `Licenses`, `Files` and so on);

3. Go to the `GEO Knowledge Hub` and follow the [step-by-step](#step-by-step) guide to create a *Knowledge Package*.

### Step-by-step

To create your *Knowledge Package*, follow the step-by-step instructions on the following pages.
