After filling in the metadata, you can set the visibility of the *Knowledge Package*. To do this, use the available options in the [Visibility menu](2_deposit-interface.md).

There are two options available in this menu:

- **Full record**: Indicates the visibility that will be assigned to the entire Knowledge Package, which includes its metadata, files, and resources;

- **Files only**: Visibility that will be applied only to the files associated with the Knowledge Package.

In both cases, you can set two values:

- `Public`: All users will have access to the content;

- `Restricted`: Only invited users will be able to view the content.

Using these options, you can define how other `GEO Knowledge Hub`  users will see and use the content you publish.

:::tip

If you are creating a `Restricted` *Knowledge Package*, check out the [Sharing packages](../sharing/sharing.md) section to learn how to share this *Package* with other users.

In addition to the details mentioned, it should notice that since the visibility change is made for the entire *Knowledge Package*, this will include the Knowledge Resources. So, if you set the **Full record** option to `Public`, the resources can be either `Public` or `Restricted`. But if you set `Restricted`, then the resources must be `Restricted`.

Finally, after making your changes, **remember to save** the changes you have made.
