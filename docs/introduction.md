# The GEO Knowledge Hub

The GEO Knowledge Hub (GKH) is a central cloud-based digital library providing access to Earth Observations based applications developed by the GEO Work Programme Activities and other authoritative sources of EO based open applications 

The scope of the GKH is to promote the replicability and re-usability of EO based applications by sharing with the end user all the Knowledge Resources essential to fully understand and re-use them. All knowledge resources of a registered EO application, are openly shared, curated and organized into a Knowledge Package, including: (A) Research papers and reports describing methods and results; (B) Software algorithms and cloud computing resources used for processing; (C) In situ and satellite imagery data used and; (D) Results for verification. 

## Who is it for

**Knowledge Users**

The GEO Knowledge Hub is mainly designed to allow technical users who look for open Earth Observations based solutions to be able to re-use it in their area of interest. Each of the GEO Knowledge Hub packages describes the type of users for which the EO application has been designed for.  

Bringing the work of all the GEO Work Programme (GWP) activities together into one repository, allows the user to have a more complete overview of all the solutions/applications offered by GEO on any given problematic. Besides, users could be brought to specific EO applications through the GKH that might not find them otherwise. 

**Knowledge Providers**

Knowledge Providers have the possibility to register their open EO based applications in the Knowledge Hub and allowing users to understand, familiarize and re-use. It does allow GWP activities to establish synergies focusing on cross cutting areas.

Maintenance cost for knowledge packages is minimal, while exposure to the community is greater as GKH is the place for GEO to share knowledge and solutions available.  

The only further interaction needed from the knowledge provider is the occasional update as changes occur.

## What it can do for me

Inside the GKH, the user will find EO applications organized in Knowledge Packages (KP) with all the necessary components (Knowledge Resources). All the Knowledge Resources are directly shared, curated and organized by the Knowledge provider to ensure replicability with proper documentation. Each resource has its own page, with the related files and metadata, and every record is linked to a Knowledge Package, allowing the user to see how a particular record such as a dataset or a publication is part of an EO application
