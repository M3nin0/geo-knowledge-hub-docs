# The GEO Knowledge Hub

The `GEO Knowledge Hub` is a central cloud-based digital library providing access to Earth Observations based applications developed by the GEO Work Programme Activities and other authoritative sources of EO based open applications.

## Scope

The scope of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` is to promote the replicability and re-usability of EO based applications by sharing with the end user all the Knowledge Resources essential to fully understand and re-use them. All knowledge resources of a registered EO application, are openly shared, curated and organized into a Knowledge Package, including: 

1. Research papers and reports describing methods and results;
2. Software algorithms and cloud computing resources used for processing;
3. In situ and satellite imagery data used;
4. Results for verification

## Discover

Inside the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, the user will find EO applications organized in Knowledge Packages with all the necessary components (Knowledge Resources). All the Knowledge Resources are directly shared, curated and organized by the Knowledge to ensure replicability with proper documentation.

Each resource has its own page, with the related files and metadata, and every record is linked to a Knowledge Package, allowing the user to see how a particular record such as a dataset or a publication is part of an EO application. In the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, several formats and resource types may be retrieved, including the following:

## Communities

Experts from the GEO community will use the `GEO Knowledge Hub` to share their work and make it easily reusable by others. The Communities feature of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` will help to organize the content of the EO applications around thematic areas such as GEO Work Programme activities, GEO engagement priorities and Global Policy Frameworks.

The providers, as active members of these communities will have the possibility to manage their knowledge and to curate the records before they are published. End-users will be able to find records that are linked to a specific community, to facilitate retrieval of information.

Finally, through the different communities, end-users will also have the possibility to ask questions directly to the providers and get help from them if they encountered problems with the application.

## Contribute

The GEO Knowledge Hub offers you a place where you can make your solution visible and available to the rest of the world, in an open-knowledge approach! To ensure long term discoverability of your work, you will be able to assign DOI - * **D**igital **O**bject **I**dentifiers* and maintain it up to date with version management functionalities.

You are a member of a GWP activity or an EO expert and want to share an EO Application developed within your activity? You are in the right place!

## Features

The GEO Knowledge Hub is built with high attention to the users and providers experience. Below is a list of the main features available in the digital library:

## Why use the GEO Knowledge Hub ?

Sometimes questions arise about why the GEO community should use the GEO Knowledge Hub. This section presents answers to the top questions we receive. We hope to clear up your doubts about why you should consider starting to use the GEO digital library `today`!

### Who is it for ?

The answer to this question can have several points of view. So here we will focus on two main points of view:

**Users who need to access reproducible applications**

The `GEO Knowledge Hub` is mainly designed to allow technical users who look for open Earth Observations based solutions to be able to re-use it in their area of interest. Each of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` packages describes the type of users for which the EO application has been designed for.

Bringing the work of all the **GEO** **W**ork **P**rogramme activities together into one repository, allows the user to have a more complete overview of all the solutions/applications offered by GEO on any given problematic. Besides, users could be brought to specific EO applications through the `GEO Knowledge Hub` that might not find them otherwise. 

**Users who need to share and preserve reproducible applications**

Knowledge Providers have the possibility to register their open EO based applications in the Knowledge Hub and allowing users to understand, familiarize and re-use. It does allow GWP activities to establish synergies focusing on cross cutting areas.

Maintenance cost for knowledge packages is minimal, while exposure to the community is greater as `GEO Knowledge Hub` is the place for GEO to share knowledge and solutions available.  

The only further interaction needed from the knowledge provider is the occasional update as changes occur.

## What it can do for me ?

Inside the GEO Knowledge Hub, the user will find EO applications organized in *Knowledge Packages* with all the necessary components to learn and reuse the application shared. All the *Knowledge Resources* are directly shared, curated and organized by the Knowledge provider to ensure replicability with proper documentation. Each resource has its own page, with the related files and metadata, and every record is linked to a Knowledge Package, allowing the user to see how a particular record such as a dataset or a publication is part of an EO application
