The most important part of the GEO Knowledge Hub is the people. They are the ones who produce and use the knowledge preserved and shared in the digital library. Without people, there is no reason for the platform to be created. We defined some roles in the system to divide the people's responsibilities well to avoid disturbing users with many needs or pre-steps to use the shared content. To these roles, we associate some responsibilities. In total, we have three roles, they are:

###  Knowledge User

A `Knowledge User` is a user who accesses the GEO Knowledge Hub to learn more about the available content and use it to produce new applications. In addition, a `Knowledge User` can interact with the community to troubleshoot, evaluate, and share information about the shared materials.

### Knowledge Provider

The `Knowledge Provider` is a special kind of `Knowledge User`. That is, in addition to using the materials already available and interacting with the community, the users with this role can also share materials in the form of `Knowledge Packages` and `Knowledge Resources`. Also, as a user who produces content, a `Provider` is responsible for curating, updating, and managing the materials, it shares on the platform. By becoming a `Provider`, people commit to the GEO community to consistently share all the materials necessary for understanding and reusing an application.
