# Sharing Units

An Earth Observation Application represents the work developed by specialists and researchers using Earth Observation data to understand the phenomena of the earth. Different agents can then use the knowledge generated with these applications to build a more sustainable society that uses natural resources more consciously.

These applications are constructed by creating and using different materials, such as Earth Observation data, processing scripts, and many others. The `GEO Knowledge Hub` is a digital library that allows experts and researchers to share their applications, along with all the materials used to obtain their results. To share, disseminate and consistently use these materials, the digital library has defined *sharing units*. These units facilitate the organization and sharing of Earth Observation applications.

In this section of the documentation, the *sharing units* used in the `GEO Knowledge Hub` will be presented in detail.
