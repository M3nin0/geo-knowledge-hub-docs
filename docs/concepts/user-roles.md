The most important part of the `GEO Knowledge Hub` is the **people**. They are the ones who produce and use the knowledge preserved and shared in the digital library. Without people, there is no reason for the platform to be created. To create a  easy to use system and avoid misunderstanding what users can do using the `GEO Knowledge Hub` we define some *user roles*. To these roles, we associate some responsibilities. In total, we have two roles, they are:Â 

### User

A *User* is a person who accesses the `GEO Knowledge Hub` to learn more about the available content and use it to produce new applications. In addition, a *User* can interact with the community to solve issues, evaluate, and share information about the shared materials.

When you create an account using the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, that account automatically has the role *User*. This allows you to explore the digital library's contents and interact with the community. If you want to become a *User*, create your account. To do so, go to the `GEO Knowledge Hub` website at: https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/

### Knowledge Provider

The *Knowledge Provider* is a special kind of *User*. That is, in addition to using the materials already available and interacting with the community, the users with this role can also share materials in the form of [Knowledge Packages](/docs/concepts/sharing-units/concepts-sharing-units-packages) and [Knowledge Resources](/docs/concepts/sharing-units/concepts-sharing-units-resources). Also, as a user who produces content, a *Provider* is responsible for curating, updating, and managing the materials, it shares on the platform. By becoming a *Provider*, people commit to the `GEO community` to consistently share all the materials necessary for understanding and reusing an application.

To start sharing and preserving your applications using the `GEO Knowledge Hub` as a *Knowledge Provider*, please, contact the `GEO Knowledge Hub Team` at the `GEO Secretariat`: secretariat@geosec.org
