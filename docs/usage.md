Using the GEO Knowledge Hub is simple, free, and open to all members of the `GEO Community`. In this use, your experience is divided into two parts:

**Discovery and use of Earth Observation applications**

Based on the search and discovery functionality of the materials, in the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, you can find all materials from an Earth Observation application. With these materials, you can learn new concepts, use them in your projects, or even build new applications.

**Sharing Earth Observation Applications**

In addition to using the materials already available on the `GEO Knowledge Hub`, you can also share your Earth Observation applications and the associated materials. This way, other members of the `GEO Community` can learn, reuse, and advance what you are developing.
