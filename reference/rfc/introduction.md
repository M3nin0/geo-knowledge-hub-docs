# Introduction

To develop software components that meet the needs of GEO Knowledge Hub users and collaborators. These are developed in an open source way so that everyone can make suggestions, improvements, and changes. To improve the communication and documentation of the design choices used in the code development, we first create a specification. In this specification, we describe the responsibilities and the details on how the component will work. For these specifications, following the steps of InvenioRDM, we use **R**equest **F**or **C**omments (RFC).

This chapter stores the RFCs of all GEO Knowledge Hub components maintained on the platform. If you would like to contribute, please edit the content of the pages in the [geo-rfc](https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-rfc) repository.
